# RecommenderSystem
Project for my Bachelor Thesis. Uses different machine learning techniques to create recommender system for books. In this project and used books descriptions and theirs reviews from Amazon dataset. I used k-means algorithm to cluster books into smaller data sets. For sentiment classification of books reviews, I used logistic regression.

Project is divided into three parts. First part is MySQL database, in which all data are stored. Second part is written in Python and performs machine learning algorithms. i used scikit-learn library for clustering and classification methods and NLTK library for preprocessing of book descriptions and reviews. Third part is GUI written in JavaFX, which shows how system works.
